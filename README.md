## Installation

To run `main.py`, you only need to install the OpenCV library (`opencv-python`). Follow one of the methods below to set up your environment.

### Option 1: Install OpenCV without a Virtual Environment
If you prefer to install OpenCV directly without creating a virtual environment, run the following command in your terminal:

pip install opencv-python

### Option 2: Install OpenCV with a Virtual Environment
Creating a virtual environment helps manage dependencies and keep your system Python installation clean. Follow these steps:

Set up a virtual environment by following the instructions in this guide:-

Once inside your virtual environment, install OpenCV with:
pip install opencv-python


With OpenCV installed, you're ready to run main.py.
